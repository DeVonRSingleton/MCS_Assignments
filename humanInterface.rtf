\f0\fs24 \cf0 UIKit is a 
\f1 programming framework that defines common interface elements. Important to enable the user to feel in control of he app while also getting rid of undesired outcomes. Let the user what is going on at most of time so they don\'92t wonder what is happening or get bored from nothing going on. A way to decrease the sense of a long load Time include fun videos or photo or even instruction non how the app work. Use of modality to force the user to interact or receive a piece of information , multiple ways of doing this. When available give a list of options so you can know what is expected instead of providing textfield for them to type in unpredictable entry for options. Don\'92t request too much from the user  to perform basic operation of app, ask for information when it is the way to operate the app and let the user know why the information is important. Provide feedback to allow the user to know what they just finished doing or even the progress of a certain task by displaying the file size. Don\'92t make user backtrack if the app open back up it should pop back up to the last place left.}
